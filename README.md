# Lab 1 Assembly Programs

## Overview

This repository features MIPS assembly language programs from Lab 1, focusing on fundamental to advanced programming concepts using the MARS MIPS simulator.

## Programs

### Summation Program (`lab1_1.asm`)
- **Objective**: Sum integers from 1 to N.
- **Method**: Loops through integers up to N, summing them.
- **Output**: Total sum.

### Efficient Summation (`lab1_2.asm`)
- **Objective**: Sum from 1 to N without loops.
- **Method**: Uses the formula `N * (N + 1) / 2`.
- **Output**: Calculated sum.

### Array Reversal (`lab1_3.asm`)
- **Objective**: Reverse array elements.
- **Method**: Stores user inputs in an array and reverses it.
- **Output**: Original and reversed arrays.

## Running the Programs
1. Open MARS MIPS simulator.
2. Load the `.asm` file.
3. Assemble and run.
4. Follow prompts for input.
